🧠 **Overview**
This project simulates a mini data warehouse environment using Databricks. It demonstrates how to build ETL pipelines, load data incrementally, and model data using Star and Snowflake schemas. It also includes implementation of Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD Type 1).

📚 **Key Concepts Covered**
What is a Data Warehouse?
Database vs. Data Warehouse
ETL Layers (Staging, ODS, EDW)
Incremental Data Loading
Dimensional Data Modeling
Star Schema vs. Snowflake Schema
Fact and Dimension Tables
Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD Type 1)

🛠️ **Technologies Used**
Databricks Community Edition
SQL

🚀 **Implementation Highlights**
✅ Created ETL pipelines using Spark SQL
✅ Performed incremental data loading using Delta Lake
✅ Designed Star and Snowflake schemas
✅ Implemented SCD Type 1 logic for dimension updates
✅ Used Databricks notebooks for development and testing



🧪** How to Run**
Sign up for a free Databricks Community Edition
recreate notebooks 
Run the SQL cells step-by-step to simulate ETL and data modeling

📘 **Learnings**
Understood the architecture and purpose of a data warehouse
Learned how to model data using fact and dimension tables
Gained hands-on experience with Spark SQL 
Practiced implementing real-world data warehousing patterns
